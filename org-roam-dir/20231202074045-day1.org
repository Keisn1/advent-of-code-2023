- read this https://go.dev/blog/strings
- need to take into account how go is treating strings, and how Go encodes strings
- needed to learn how to read a file in GO
  - still don't know how to assess the number of lines in a text file
- the algorithm is linear
  - could be better when i use two pointers, but it becomes more difficult, since I need (wanted) to take into account non ASCII characters
- need to write a function that returns a slice of strings, so i can decapsulate the reading from the rest of the algorithm
